### 2025 K-DRAMA
#### Yeon Ji-young (female protagonist), a modern-day French chef, time-travels to Korea’s Joseon dynasty during a solar eclipse. Mistaken for a spy, she saves herself by astonishing the young, tyrannical King Yi Heon (male protagonist) with her modern cooking skills and becomes the palace’s head chef. This fantasy-romance K-drama blends historical intrigue, comedy, and love as she adapts to palace life, faces political rivals, and deepens her bond with the king through her extraordinary dishes.
